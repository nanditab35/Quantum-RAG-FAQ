# Quantum-RAG-FAQ

This repository contains a collection of notebooks for building and evaluating a RAG application on the topic of Quantum Mechanics. It demonstrates various retrieval strategies, such as Vector RAG and Graph RAG, and includes a pipeline for extracting a Knowledge Graph from the training documents. Following Notebooks coming soon... :) (one by one)
* Vector RAG
* Graph RAG => Coming soon
* Extracting Knowledge Graph => Coming soon
