# Quantum-RAG-FAQ

This repository contains a collection of notebooks for building and evaluating a RAG application on the topic of Quantum Mechanics. It demonstrates various retrieval strategies, such as Vector RAG and Graph RAG, and includes a pipeline for extracting a Knowledge Graph from the training documents. Following Notebooks coming soon... :) (one by one)
* Vector RAG
  - Code: V1_V2-(VectorRAG_Reranker) For QM FAQ.ipynb
  - Blog: https://www.kaggle.com/code/nanditab35/vectorrag-reranker-for-qm-faq
* Extracting Knowledge Graph => Coming soon
* Graph RAG => Coming soon
* Hybrid RAG (Vector+Graph) => Coming soon
